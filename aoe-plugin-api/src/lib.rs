//! Plugin manifest types for the Agent of Empires plugin system.
//!
//! This crate is the stable surface a plugin author (and the in-tree host)
//! compiles against: the `aoe-plugin.toml` manifest schema, the capability
//! taxonomy, and the validation rules that gate a manifest before it loads.
//! The contribution sections (settings, keybinds, themes, commands, status,
//! ui, panes, runtime worker) are defined here but consumed by follow-up PRs
//! (#2094 / #2095 / #2366). See
//! `docs/development/internals/plugin-system.md`.
